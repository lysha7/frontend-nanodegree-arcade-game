## About

This app was created as part of a Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree project. Udacity provided the images, game board, and game engine. I added the player and enemy classes, properties, and methods in app.js.

## Installation

No installation is required. Play directly in your browser by following this link: https://lysha7.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/. Or download the files and open index.html in a browser to play locally.

## Instructions

The game is reminiscent of the classic game Frogger. Using the up, down, right, and left arrow keys, guide your player across the road and to the water, while avoiding enemy bugs!

## Acknowledgements

Udacity Scholar Rodrick provided an excellent [video walkthrough](https://zoom.us/recording/play/aulotDlzKFegQFIJTaTzKgWvNkVsYtlwO454vL1UPE1Cm6lOUBQCtfVurPOIAGAS?startTime=1529542978000) of this project, which was helpful in getting me started.

## Contributing

This is a project for a course, so I will not be actively maintaining it.

## Future Development

In the future, I would like to return to this project to add additional features, such as increasing levels of difficulty and losing lives each time the player is hit.
